# Ionic Issue Reproduction Repository

This is a simple ionic repository to reproduce an issue with the `<ion-datetime>`
component when it is included in an `<ion-modal>` component and opened on click of an `<ion-input type="date">` component.
It was generated with the Ionic "Getting Started Wizard" (https://ionicframework.com/start#basics).

Issue: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/26234
